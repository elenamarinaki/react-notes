# React Basics ‚öõÔ∏è

## ‚ö†Ô∏è

To add auto-complete in React:

- `Command + Shift + P`
- Preferences: Configure language specific settings => JavaScript => opens `settings.json`
- Added:
  ```js
  "emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab": true,
  "emmet.includeLanguages": {
  "javascript": "javascriptreact"
  }
  ```

### Create React App üç∞

`npx create-react-app [app_name]`
`cd [app_name]`
`npm start`

### Class Components

- We can write functions that return HTML, but we can also write **Classes** that return HTML.
- React gives us more functionality through Classes, than just writing a function.
- Implementation:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
```

‚¨áÔ∏è Turning the function App into a Component...

```js
class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (

        );
    }
}
```

‚Ü™Ô∏è another way to do it ...

```js
import React from 'react';
```

and instead we add it after the `extends` keyword

```js
class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (

        );
    }
}
```

- The `return ();` that was going inside the _function App_, now goes into a class. This way we can make use of special functionalities of the classes, like the `render()` method.
- The `render()` method returns HTML.
- `super()` helps us by calling `React.Component`'s `constructor()`üöó
- the **components** have some **built-in methods**

### JSX Attributes ü¶©

- `className` instead of `class`, because `class` means something else in JavaScript.
- `{}` is a JS expression, a variable, something that produces a value, eg. `src={}`, `<p>{4 + 5}</p>`
- `onClick` instead of `onclick`
- `Babel` will convert JSX to regular JS

### Uni-directional Flow üåä

- We are not allowed to modify state in React without calling the `setState()` method.
- When we set the state to something different, the `render()` method gets called again, so we can re-render the component in the new state.

### Map() + _key_ attribute üó∫Ô∏è üîë

- Anytime you use the `map()` function inside of _render_, or you have a list of the **same jsx elements** one after another, **they need a key attribute** (and CRA will warn you about it if you miss it)

### SPA: Single Page Application üìÑ

- instead of requesting a page, we are just requesting for **data**, which is being rendered in the page we already are.
- we get the ability to communicate with outside servers, with servers we don't control.
- the API provides us a way to access info from a server

### Lifecycle Methods :cyclone:

- they get called at different stages automatically by React, based on when the component is getting rendered.
- **componentDidMount**: The `componentDidMount()` method allows us to execute the React code _when the component is already placed in the DOM_ (Document Object Model). This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e after the component is rendered.

### Props üß±

- any parameters that we pass inside a created component
- is going to be an `object` of ANY properties I pass onto my component in use

In `card-list.component.jsx` :

```js
import React from 'react';

export const CardList = (props) => {
  console.log(props);
  return <div>Hello</div>;
};
```

...and inside `App.js`

```js
<CardList name='Elena' />
```

_becomes..._

```js
{
  name: 'Elena';
}
```

‚ú®

- The props have children!
  If in `App.js` we pass:

```js
<CardList name='Elena'>Elena2</CardList>
```

... the `Elena2` is a **prop child**! Or anything in between these tags!!

In `card-list.component.jsx`:

```js
import React from 'react';

export const CardList = (props) => {
  console.log(props);
  return <div>{props.children}</div>;
};
```

### The job of a React Developer ü§î

- Decide on **Components**
- Decide the **State** and _where it lives_
- _What_ changes _when_ state changes?

Benefits => more flexibility, re-usable components, easier testing! ‚ú®

### State VS Props ü™ë

- A **state** is passed down to a component as an **_attribute_** (just like HTML).
- As soon as we pass a state as component, the component receives this state as a **prop**.
- State changes because of user interaction.
- The key attribute helps React distinguish multiple components of the same kind. This way, updating the DOM is so efficient.
- _State can be anywhere_, not only in the App.js component.

#### üç¨ The `onChange` event in React detects when the value of an input element changes.

#### üßÅ The `setState` is an _asynchronous_ function.

#### üçß Events in React universe => _Synthetic_ events: detect when DOM events happen.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è We cannot use `setState` inside `render()`, it will create a loop.
